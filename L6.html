        Traditional Media
     </h2>

     <p>
        Traditional media refers to advertising channels that have been used for decades. Businesses have relied on these methods, which can be very powerful and sometimes make up the entire advertising budget. Examples include TV commercials, radio ads, cold calling, flyers, billboards, door-to-door sales, and newspaper ads. Although these channels have been important for years, their influence has been steadily declining in recent times.

        Benefits to the society
     </h2>

     <p>
          Electronic media has brought many benefits to society. It eliminates the barriers of distance and time, making it easier to share information, events, and ideas. People now have simple and widespread access to information, and sharing it has become less expensive and easier. Two-way communication is now simple, allowing people to exchange thoughts and ideas. The broad reach and low cost of electronic media help spread information widely. In politics, electronic media allows equal opportunities for all parties to raise issues, supporting a more democratic exchange of ideas.

        History of Radio
     </h2>

     <p>
        The history of radio began with Morse code, developed by Samuel F.B. Morse, which used dots and dashes to send messages and urgent distress signals. Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, studied radio waves and showed that signals could be transmitted wirelessly, with frequency measured in hertz. Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian inventor, created a device in 1896 that could ring a bell from 30 feet away, marking an early step in wireless communication. By 1916, radio was used to broadcast news, and by 1927 it had become a key source of information. Radio broadcasting in India started in 1923–1924 with radio clubs in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras. During World War II, radio transmission gained even greater importance.
