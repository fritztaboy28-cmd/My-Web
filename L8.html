            Legal, Ethical and Societal Issues
        </h2>

        <p>
        Legal, ethical, and societal issues are important in technology and software development. Legal issues deal with following laws, rules, and policies about technology, data, and intellectual property. Ethics focus on what is morally right or fair, even if it’s not required by law. Societal issues consider how technology affects communities, culture, economies, and people’s well-being. Understanding these issues helps create technology that is fair, safe, and trusted.
