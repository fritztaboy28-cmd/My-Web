            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            Any goal-oriented activity that requires, benefits from, or creates
computer machinery is referred to as computing.
        </p>
        <p>
It deals with the use of technology and how it affects human in a
positive way.
        </p>
        <p>
            In business, computing industry is defined as a sector of any given
economy that is concerned with technology research, development,
sales and production.

            Computing
        </h2>

        <p>
         Computing is any goal-oriented activity that requires or creates computer machinery, focusing on using technology to benefit humans.t’s any goal-driven activity where you use or build computer hardware. Essentially, it's using technology to solve problems and make human life easier.

            Computer Science
        </h2>

        <P>
            This branch of science deals with the theory of computation and the design of computers. This is the scientific study of how computers are designed and the theories behind how they "think." In modern science, these theories are proven and testable, not just guesses.

            The Three Great Insights
        </h2>

        <p>
            First, computers can represent any complex things, like a photo or games, using just two objects, being zero's (0) and one's (1). Second, they can perform any task using only five basic actions. Third, A computer can combine its five actions in only three ways.

             Information Technology 
        </h2>

        <p>
           IT refers to the field focused on developing, maintaining, and using computer systems, software, and networks to process and distribute data. Its primary emphasis is on managing and sharing information through computers, with additional use of telecommunications and broadcast technologies. Companies and professionals working in this field are collectively known as the tech sector.

            Theory of Computation 
        </h2>

        <p>
            A  field that studies how efficiently problems can be solved using algorithms within formal models of computation, often relying on symbols and digits. A major branch of this theory is automata theory, which examines abstract machines and plays an important role in the development of artificial intelligence. Overall, the theory of computation seeks to understand the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers—what they can and cannot compute.

            Computing Industry in the Philippines
        </h2>

        <p>
            Computing Industry in the Philippines has grown significantly in recent years as part of the country’s Information Economy (IE), which includes sectors that use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to produce, store, and transmit information. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), this economy covers both ICT-related industries and content and media sectors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recent surveys, such as the 2021 Survey on Information and Communications Technology (SICT), show increased ICT utilization across industries. Over half of employees in the core IE routinely used computers and had internet access, with even higher usage in ICT-enabled services. The industry has also seen rapid growth in mobile transactions, reflecting wider reliance on mobile technology for business. Additionally, e-commerce and digital engagement continue to expand, as more businesses conduct online transactions and maintain active social media presence.In 2021, the ICT services sector employed around 752,142 workers, a
large proportion of whom routinely used computers​.
