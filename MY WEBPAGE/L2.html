            Introduction

        </h2>

        <p>
            Computing will require input and process of using technology to
            produce a desired output that can be applicable to any industry.
            Whereas science is any system of knowledge that is concerned with the
            physical world and its phenomena and that entails unbiased
            observations and systematic experimentation.

              Computing and Formal Science 
        </h2>

        <p>
           As computing is considered a formal science that relies on mathematically defined logic systems to produce results. Formal sciences include fields such as mathematics, logic, computer science, statistics, cryptography, information technology, and robotics. These disciplines use abstract logical frameworks—such as numerical values and true/false reasoning—which can be applied to both natural and social sciences through quantitative research. Mathematics and logic are among the oldest scientific disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the rise of computer technology, formal sciences have greatly benefited from computing tools. Calculators enhance mathematical computation, spreadsheets support statistical analysis, and advances in robotics and artificial intelligence combine mathematical models with logical reasoning. Additionally, virtual environments provide shared spaces for testing and implementing new mathematical and logical concepts.

            Computing and Natural Science
        </h2>

        <p>
            Computing and Natural Science are closely linked, as natural science focuses on observing, explaining, and predicting natural phenomena through experimentation and quantitative research. Fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, and environmental science rely on measurable data and emphasize validity, accuracy, and peer review. Disciplines like biology and astronomy are among the oldest natural sciences.

            Computing and Social Science 
        </h2>

        <p>
           As social science studies society and relationships among humans. Fields such as anthropology, archaeology, education, geography, psychology, and sociology often rely on both qualitative and quantitative research, with a stronger emphasis on qualitative data. Disciplines like anthropology and archaeology have helped reveal how human behavior and societies have shaped the development of science over time. In the current era, Developments in computing have greatly supported social sciences. Online surveys and censuses simplify data collection, educational websites and the internet connect people across distances, social networks help researchers analyze societal trends, and digital tools such as laptops and projectors enhance teaching and learning.
