            Abacus
        </h2>

        <p>
            The abacus is one of the earliest computing tools, dating back to the Mesopotamian period. It can perform the four basic arithmetic operations and is still used today by traders and merchants for calculations. Because it requires no power source, the abacus remains highly practical and is also accessible to visually impaired users, who may find it easier to use than electronic calculators.

            Astrolabe
        </h2>

        <p>
         The astrolabe is an early computing and astronomical instrument developed during the Hellenistic civilization. It functions as an inclinometer and is used to determine the altitude of celestial bodies above the horizon. The astrolabe can also identify local latitude, measure the time of day or year, and determine the orientation of the North Polar Sequence (NPS), making it an essential tool for early astronomy and navigation.

            Analytical Engine
        </h2>

        <p>
            The Analytical Engine, designed and partially built by Charles Babbage, is considered the first computer. It was based on the earlier Difference Engine, a simpler calculating machine. The Analytical Engine was designed as a general-purpose computing machine and introduced fundamental computer components, including the store (memory), mill (processor), reader (input device), and printer (output device)—concepts that form the basis of modern computers.

        <p>
            Built in 1943, was one of the first electronic general-purpose computers. It was specifically designed to compute artillery range tables for the military. Its development was so influential that it contributed to the formation of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), a key professional organization in computing.

            Computer System
        </h2>

        <p>
        It consists of hardware and software that work together to accept data (input), process it, and provide output in a user-understandable form. Computers do not naturally understand human language; they operate using bits (binary digits), the basic unit of information, which have only two states:  0 being False (off), 1 being True (On)    
        </p>

        <p>
            The working definition of a computer system posits that it is
comprised of functional entities, namely the hardware and software,
which together are able to accept data (input), process it and provide
feedback (output) in a format that can be understood by the user.

            Parts of The computer system

            Hardware 
        </h3>

        <p>
        Hardware is the physical part of a computer that you can touch. It includes input devices, which let the user enter data and commands; the central processing unit (CPU), which is like the brain of the computer that performs calculations and runs programs; and output devices, which show the results to the user. The CPU has three main parts: the memory unit to store data, the control unit to manage operations, and the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) to do math and logic tasks. All of these work together to process information and make the computer run.

            Software
        </h3>

       <p>
        Software is the part of a computer system that you cannot touch. It includes programs or applications that tell the computer what to do. There are two main types: system software and application software. System software includes the operating system, which manages the computer and runs other programs; device drivers, which help the computer talk to hardware; firmware, which controls devices and is stored in ROM; program language translators, which change human-readable code into machine code; and utilities, which help keep the computer running well. Application software is used to do specific tasks, like writing documents, browsing the internet, or playing games.

            Memory
        </h3>

         <p>
         Memory is where the computer stores data and instructions so the CPU can use them. There are three main types. Primary memory is directly accessed by the CPU and includes RAM, which is fast but loses data when the computer is off, and ROM, which keeps data even when the computer is turned off. Secondary memory is used for long-term storage and is not accessed directly by the CPU, like hard drives. Cache memory is a small, fast type of memory that holds data the CPU uses often to make the computer work faster.

            CPU machine cycle
        </h2>

        <p>
        The CPU machine cycle has four steps. First is Fetch, where the CPU gets data and instructions from memory. Next is Decode, where the control unit interprets what the data and instructions mean. Then comes Execute, where the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs calculations or operations. Finally,Store is when the CPU saves the results back into memory.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2 id="e">
            The control unit
        </h2>
        
       <p> 
        The control unit (CU) directs the memory unit, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and input/output (I/O) devices, telling them how to respond to commands. It controls the flow of data between the CPU and other parts of the computer system. The control unit gets instructions from memory, interprets them, and directs the operation of the other units.
       </p>

     <div>
        <h2 id="e">
             The arithmetic logic unit
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs arithmetic and logical operations. It usually works with bitwise operations, which are simple and fast, but some ALUs can also handle floating point operations. The ALU receives data called operands, processes them according to the chosen operation, and gives the result. It has two main parts: the arithmetic unit, which handles numerical operations like addition, subtraction, increment, decrement, negation, and operations with carry or borrow; and the logic unit, which handles logical tests and operations like AND, OR, and NOT.

            Computer Buses (Bus)
        </h2>
        
       <p> 
         A computer bus is a system that transfers data between different parts of a computer. A well-known example is the universal serial bus (USB). Many people mistakenly call external storage devices “USBs,” but the correct term is “flash drive,” which is a storage device that uses flash memory and connects to the computer through USB hardware.

            Evolution of Computing
        </h2>
        
        <p>
         Modern society is in the 21st century Digital Era, which followed the Industrial Revolution. This era focuses on the growth of digital technology, the spread of knowledge and information through digital methods, and the economic impact of information technology. Content can now be accessed electronically through video and audio recordings, slideshows, and online materials, which is called electronic media. Devices used for electronic communication, such as televisions, smartphones, and game controllers, are also considered electronic media, and most of them are computer systems.

            Electronic Media
        </h2>
        
        <p> 
         Electronic media began with the invention of transmission, such as the telegraph. In telecommunications, transmission is the process of sending a signal using a medium. There are two types of signals: analog, which is a continuous electrical signal where a changing quantity like voltage represents a variable over time, and digital, which represents data as a sequence of separate, finite values.

            The Internet 
        </h2>
        
        <p> 
         The Internet is a system of globally connected computer networks that communicate using the internet protocol suite, including TCP and IP. It provides access to many sources of information, such as the World Wide Web, email, file sharing, cloud services, and voice over internet protocol (VOIP). The Internet connects millions of computer systems and is a key part of the Digital Era, enabling electronic media, online content, instant messaging, online shopping, social networking, and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Blockchain games, such as CryptoKitties and Axie Infinity, are also rising, using cryptographic blockchain technology in gaming.
