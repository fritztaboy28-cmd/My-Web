            Number System
        </h2>
        
        <p> 
         A number system is a method of writing, representing, and expressing numbers using specific rules. It is a mathematical notation that uses digits or symbols in a consistent way to represent numbers. Number systems provide a way to communicate information that is easy for humans to understand and for computers to process.

            Why it is important?
        </h3>

        <p>
         A number system allows us to depict, represent, or associate objects or things with a quantity. It makes it easier to compare quantities to certain values or aspects and helps represent and communicate information in a way that computers can process and understand

            Decimal Number
        </h2>

        <p>
            The decimal number system is the most common number system used by humans because it is based on 10, the number of fingers on our hands. It is used to represent whole numbers, fractions, and decimals, as well as real-world quantities like time, weight, length, and money. In computer science, it is also used to represent floating-point numbers, which are real numbers with fractional parts. The decimal system is used in many applications, including finance, accounting, scientific calculations, and to express data like file sizes or computer speeds, making it easier to process and compare information.

            Octal Number 
        </h2>

        <p>
            The octal number system, or base-8, is not as commonly used today but still has some applications. It is often used in digital electronics to represent groups of three binary digits. The system is also used as a shorthand for file permissions on UNIX systems and in representing UTF-8 numbers. While its use is limited, the octal system remains useful in certain areas of computer science and electronics.

            Hexadecimal Number
        </h2>

        <p>
            The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 system that uses 16 digits, from 0 to 9 and A to F, to represent numbers. It is widely used in computer science and digital electronics. Hexadecimal is common in programming because it is more compact than binary and easier to read than decimal. It is also used to represent colors in HTML and CSS, where colors are shown as six-digit hexadecimal numbers. Additionally, hexadecimal is used in cryptography to represent keys and other sensitive information.

            Binary Number 
        </h2>

        <p>
        The binary number system is a base-2 system that uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent numbers. It is widely used in digital electronics and computer science to represent data and instructions in computers because it can be easily implemented with electronic circuits. Binary is also used in cryptography to represent keys and other sensitive information.

            Number System Conversion
        </h2>

        <p>
            Number system conversion is the process of changing a number from one base to another. This is needed because different number systems are used for different purposes. Conversion allows arithmetic operations on numbers in different bases and is also important in fields like cryptography.

            Binary to Decimal
        </h3>

        <p>
            Binary to decimal conversion uses a positional numbering system with base 2. The powers of 2 are used to determine the place values. To convert a binary number to decimal, each binary digit is multiplied by its corresponding power of 2 and then all the results are added together.

            Decimal to Binary
        </h3>

        <p>
            There are two methods to convert a decimal number (base 10) to binary (base 2). Method 1 is short division, where the decimal number is divided by 2 repeatedly, and the remainders are recorded. Method 2 uses the powers of 2 and subtraction, where the largest powers of 2 are subtracted from the decimal number to determine the binary digits.   
        </p>

            Decimal to Octal
        </h3>

      <p>
        To convert a decimal number to octal, divide the decimal number by 8 repeatedly and write down the remainders. Then, read the remainders in reverse order to get the equivalent octal number.          
      </p>

            Decimal to Hexadecimal
        </h3>

        <p>
            To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal, first divide the decimal number by 16 and keep the remainder aside. Then, divide the quotient by 16 again and continue this process until the quotient becomes zero. Finally, write the remainders in reverse order to get the hexadecimal number.
