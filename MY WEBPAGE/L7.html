        The Usage of Internet
     </h2>

     <p>
        The Internet has many uses that make life easier and more connected. It allows people to search for information, from simple words to documents, articles, or books. Digital news is accessible instantly and without paper, making it easier to stay updated. Communication is faster and easier through messaging and video calls, allowing people to connect worldwide in real time. The Internet also enables quick data transfer, improving how businesses and individuals share information. Social networking helps people stay connected, especially during events like the pandemic, making it possible to socialize and maintain relationships even during lockdowns.

            Internet of Things (IoT)
        </h2>

        <p>
            IoT connects devices in homes, buildings, cities, transportation, airports, stations, shops, and mobile devices, allowing them to communicate and share data over networks. Pros include easy access to information from anywhere on any device, improved communication between devices, faster data transfer saving time and money, and automation of tasks that improves services and reduces human intervention. Cons include increased risk of hacking and theft of confidential information, challenges in managing data from all devices, the risk of system-wide corruption if a bug occurs, and the lack of an international standard for IoT compatibility.

            CLOUD COMPUTING
       </h2>

        <p>
            The term “Cloud” refers to a network or the Internet, meaning it is a service available at a remote location. Cloud computing provides services over public or private networks like WAN, LAN, or VPN. Many applications run in the cloud, including email, web conferencing, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.

            What is Cloud Computing?
        </h3>

        <p>
         Cloud computing is the use of online applications, storage, and computing resources over a network. It combines software and hardware delivered as a service, allowing users to access, configure, and manage applications online. Cloud computing helps companies reduce infrastructure costs while providing better management, security, scalability, and overall efficiency.

            Why do we need to learn Cloud Computing?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Learning cloud computing is important because it allows companies to have scalable, manageable, and cost-effective infrastructure. Startups and growing businesses can save money by paying only for the services they use instead of buying expensive hardware. Even large enterprise companies use cloud services to run their products and services efficiently.

            Deployment Models
        </h3>

        <p>
            Cloud computing uses different deployment models to provide access and manage resources. Public clouds are shared, cost-effective, and hosted by third parties like AWS and Azure, suitable for startups and e-commerce. Private clouds are dedicated and secure, used by organizations like banks and hospitals. Community clouds are shared by groups with similar needs, such as government or research institutions. Hybrid clouds combine public and private models to give flexibility, often used by retail chains and media companies.

            Service Models
        </h3>

        <p>
            Cloud computing services are categorized into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtualized infrastructure like servers, storage, and networking, allowing users to manage operating systems and applications—examples include AWS EC2 and Azure VMs, commonly used for hosting apps or testing environments. PaaS offers a platform for developing and deploying applications, with services like Google App Engine and Heroku, often used for web development and microservices. SaaS delivers software over the internet that users can directly access, such as Microsoft 365 or Salesforce, enabling collaboration and productivity. Additionally, Function as a Service (FaaS) allows event-driven code execution without managing servers, useful for real-time workflows and IoT data processing.

            Internet Security
        </h2>

        <p>
            Internet security refers to protecting data, transactions, and communications over the internet. It includes securing web browsers, safeguarding information entered in online forms, and ensuring that data sent through internet protocols is authenticated and protected from unauthorized access.

            Why Web Security is so Important
        </h2>

        <p>
            Web security is crucial for protecting sensitive information from hackers and cybercriminals. Without proper security measures, malware and attacks can spread across computers, networks, and other IT systems, making it hard to trace the source and increasing the risk of data breaches.

            How Do I Know if a Website Is Secure?
        </h3>

        <p>
            You can check if a website is secure by looking for HTTPS in the URL. Other signs include whether the website comes from a trusted authority, provides expert or valuable content, looks professional rather than broken or spammy, and whether the links appear safe when hovered over.

            How Do I Make My Information on the Web More Secure?
        </h3>

        <p>
            To make your information on the web more secure, use strong and unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and always connect through secure networks. Consider using multiple email addresses and avoid posting your main email publicly to reduce the risk of hacking or spam.

            INTERNET PROTOCOL
        </h2>

        <p>
            Internet Protocols are rules that let computers communicate over networks. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) sets up a connection between a client and a server. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used to send and receive data on the World Wide Web, while FTP (File Transfer Protocol) allows files to be transferred between computers over a TCP/IP network.
